                    <p>I'm an Information Technology engineering student with a current GPA of 4.9/5. I plan to <span className="highlight">graduate in August 2026</span>.</p>
                    <p>I really enjoy learning new things and figuring out how stuff works. When it comes to work, I'm dedicated and detail-oriented. <span className="highlight">I'm always looking for ways to get better at what I do</span>. I've been told I'm a quick learner, a proactive problem solver, and a nice person to work with.</p>

                    <p>Before starting my IT studies, <span className="highlight">I worked as a teacher</span> (Finnish, Finnish as a Second Language), focusing on integration training for adult immigrants. Through this experience, I developed <span className="highlight">strong communication, problem-solving, teamwork, and organizational skills.</span></p>
                    <p>While studying at university, I also worked in various sales and customer service roles. In these jobs, I strengthened my <span className="highlight">precision, flexibility, patience, and the ability to see situations from different perspectives.</span></p>
                    <p>By combining these experiences with my technical knowledge, I’m able to adapt to new challenges, approach problems from multiple angles, and work effectively in diverse teams.</p>
